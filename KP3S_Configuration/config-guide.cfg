[mcu]
serial:
#   The serial port to connect to the MCU. If unsure (or if it
#   changes) see the "Where's my serial port?" section of the FAQ.
#   This parameter must be provided when using a serial port.
#baud: 250000
#   The baud rate to use. The default is 250000.
#canbus_uuid:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the unique
#   chip identifier to connect to. This value must be provided when using
#   CAN bus for communication.
#canbus_interface:
#   If using a device connected to a CAN bus then this sets the CAN
#   network interface to use. The default is 'can0'.
#restart_method:
#   This controls the mechanism the host will use to reset the
#   micro-controller. The choices are 'arduino', 'cheetah', 'rpi_usb',
#   and 'command'. The 'arduino' method (toggle DTR) is common on
#   Arduino boards and clones. The 'cheetah' method is a special
#   method needed for some Fysetc Cheetah boards. The 'rpi_usb' method
#   is useful on Raspberry Pi boards with micro-controllers powered
#   over USB - it briefly disables power to all USB ports to
#   accomplish a micro-controller reset. The 'command' method involves
#   sending a Klipper command to the micro-controller so that it can
#   reset itself. The default is 'arduino' if the micro-controller
#   communicates over a serial port, 'command' otherwise.

[printer]
kinematics:
#   The type of printer in use. This option may be one of: cartesian,
#   corexy, corexz, hybrid_corexy, hybrid_corexz, rotary_delta, delta,
#   polar, winch, or none. This
#   parameter must be specified.
max_velocity:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
max_accel:
#   Maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the toolhead (relative to the
#   print). This parameter must be specified.
#max_accel_to_decel:
#   A pseudo acceleration (in mm/s^2) controlling how fast the
#   toolhead may go from acceleration to deceleration. It is used to
#   reduce the top speed of short zig-zag moves (and thus reduce
#   printer vibration from these moves). The default is half of
#   max_accel.
#square_corner_velocity: 5.0
#   The maximum velocity (in mm/s) that the toolhead may travel a 90
#   degree corner at. A non-zero value can reduce changes in extruder
#   flow rates by enabling instantaneous velocity changes of the
#   toolhead during cornering. This value configures the internal
#   centripetal velocity cornering algorithm; corners with angles
#   larger than 90 degrees will have a higher cornering velocity while
#   corners with angles less than 90 degrees will have a lower
#   cornering velocity. If this is set to zero then the toolhead will
#   decelerate to zero at each corner. The default is 5mm/s.

[stepper_x]
step_pin:
#   Step GPIO pin (triggered high). This parameter must be provided.
dir_pin:
#   Direction GPIO pin (high indicates positive direction). This
#   parameter must be provided.
enable_pin:
#   Enable pin (default is enable high; use ! to indicate enable
#   low). If this parameter is not provided then the stepper motor
#   driver must always be enabled.
rotation_distance:
#   Distance (in mm) that the axis travels with one full rotation of
#   the stepper motor (or final gear if gear_ratio is specified).
#   This parameter must be provided.

#   The number of microsteps the stepper motor driver uses. This
#   parameter must be provided.
#full_steps_per_rotation: 200
#   The number of full steps for one rotation of the stepper motor.
#   Set this to 200 for a 1.8 degree stepper motor or set to 400 for a
#   0.9 degree motor. The default is 200.
#gear_ratio:
#   The gear ratio if the stepper motor is connected to the axis via a
#   gearbox. For example, one may specify "5:1" if a 5 to 1 gearbox is
#   in use. If the axis has multiple gearboxes one may specify a comma
#   separated list of gear ratios (for example, "57:11, 2:1"). If a
#   gear_ratio is specified then rotation_distance specifies the
#   distance the axis travels for one full rotation of the final gear.
#   The default is to not use a gear ratio.
#step_pulse_duration:
#   The minimum time between the step pulse signal edge and the
#   following "unstep" signal edge. This is also used to set the
#   minimum time between a step pulse and a direction change signal.
#   The default is 0.000000100 (100ns) for TMC steppers that are
#   configured in UART or SPI mode, and the default is 0.000002 (which
#   is 2us) for all other steppers.
endstop_pin:
#   Endstop switch detection pin. If this endstop pin is on a
#   different mcu than the stepper motor then it enables "multi-mcu
#   homing". This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#position_min: 0
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to.  The default is 0mm.
position_endstop:
#   Location of the endstop (in mm). This parameter must be provided
#   for the X, Y, and Z steppers on cartesian style printers.
position_max:
#   Maximum valid distance (in mm) the user may command the stepper to
#   move to. This parameter must be provided for the X, Y, and Z
#   steppers on cartesian style printers.
#homing_speed: 5.0
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when homing. The default
#   is 5mm/s.
#homing_retract_dist: 5.0
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before homing a second time during
#   homing. Set this to zero to disable the second home. The default
#   is 5mm.
#homing_retract_speed:
#   Speed to use on the retract move after homing in case this should
#   be different from the homing speed, which is the default for this
#   parameter
#second_homing_speed:
#   Velocity (in mm/s) of the stepper when performing the second home.
#   The default is homing_speed/2.
#homing_positive_dir:
#   If true, homing will cause the stepper to move in a positive
#   direction (away from zero); if false, home towards zero. It is
#   better to use the default than to specify this parameter. The
#   default is true if position_endstop is near position_max and false
#   if near position_min.

[printer]
kinematics: cartesian
max_z_velocity:
#   This sets the maximum velocity (in mm/s) of movement along the z
#   axis. This setting can be used to restrict the maximum speed of
#   the z stepper motor. The default is to use max_velocity for
#   max_z_velocity.
max_z_accel:
#   This sets the maximum acceleration (in mm/s^2) of movement along
#   the z axis. It limits the acceleration of the z stepper motor. The
#   default is to use max_accel for max_z_accel.

# The stepper_x section is used to describe the stepper controlling
# the X axis in a cartesian robot.
[stepper_x]

# The stepper_y section is used to describe the stepper controlling
# the Y axis in a cartesian robot.

microsteps:
rotation_distance:
#full_steps_per_rotation:
#gear_ratio:
#   See the "stepper" section for a description of the above
#   parameters. If none of the above parameters are specified then no
#   stepper will be associated with the nozzle hotend (though a
#   SYNC_EXTRUDER_MOTION command may associate one at run-time).
nozzle_diameter:
#   Diameter of the nozzle orifice (in mm). This parameter must be
#   provided.

#   The nominal diameter of the raw filament (in mm) as it enters the
#   extruder. This parameter must be provided.
#max_extrude_cross_section:
#   Maximum area (in mm^2) of an extrusion cross section (eg,
#   extrusion width multiplied by layer height). This setting prevents
#   excessive amounts of extrusion during relatively small XY moves.
#   If a move requests an extrusion rate that would exceed this value
#   it will cause an error to be returned. The default is: 4.0 *
#   nozzle_diameter^2
#instantaneous_corner_velocity: 1.000
#   The maximum instantaneous velocity change (in mm/s) of the
#   extruder during the junction of two moves. The default is 1mm/s.
#max_extrude_only_distance: 50.0
#   Maximum length (in mm of raw filament) that a retraction or
#   extrude-only move may have. If a retraction or extrude-only move
#   requests a distance greater than this value it will cause an error
#   to be returned. The default is 50mm.
#max_extrude_only_velocity:
#max_extrude_only_accel:
#   Maximum velocity (in mm/s) and acceleration (in mm/s^2) of the
#   extruder motor for retractions and extrude-only moves. These
#   settings do not have any impact on normal printing moves. If not
#   specified then they are calculated to match the limit an XY
#   printing move with a cross section of 4.0*nozzle_diameter^2 would
#   have.
#pressure_advance: 0.0
#   The amount of raw filament to push into the extruder during
#   extruder acceleration. An equal amount of filament is retracted
#   during deceleration. It is measured in millimeters per
#   millimeter/second. The default is 0, which disables pressure
#   advance.
#pressure_advance_smooth_time: 0.040
#   A time range (in seconds) to use when calculating the average
#   extruder velocity for pressure advance. A larger value results in

#   default is 0.040 (40 milliseconds).
#
# The remaining variables describe the extruder heater.

#   PWM output pin controlling the heater. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   heater_pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set
#   fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would
#   allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This
#   setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended
#   periods) to the heater. The default is 1.0.
sensor_type:
#   Type of sensor - common thermistors are "EPCOS 100K B57560G104F",
#   "ATC Semitec 104GT-2", "ATC Semitec 104NT-4-R025H42G", "Generic

#   Analog input pin connected to the sensor. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pullup_resistor: 4700
#   The resistance (in ohms) of the pullup attached to the thermistor.

#   be smoothed to reduce the impact of measurement noise. The default
#   is 1 seconds.
control:
#   Control algorithm (either pid or watermark). This parameter must
#   be provided.
pid_Kp:
pid_Ki:
pid_Kd:
#   The proportional (pid_Kp), integral (pid_Ki), and derivative
#   (pid_Kd) settings for the PID feedback control system. Klipper
#   evaluates the PID settings with the following general formula:
#     heater_pwm = (Kp*error + Ki*integral(error) - Kd*derivative(error)) / 255
#   Where "error" is "requested_temperature - measured_temperature"
#   and "heater_pwm" is the requested heating rate with 0.0 being full
#   off and 1.0 being full on. Consider using the PID_CALIBRATE
#   command to obtain these parameters. The pid_Kp, pid_Ki, and pid_Kd
#   parameters must be provided for PID heaters.
#max_delta: 2.0
#   On 'watermark' controlled heaters this is the number of degrees in
#   Celsius above the target temperature before disabling the heater
#   as well as the number of degrees below the target before
#   re-enabling the heater. The default is 2 degrees Celsius.
#pwm_cycle_time: 0.100
#   Time in seconds for each software PWM cycle of the heater. It is
#   not recommended to set this unless there is an electrical
#   requirement to switch the heater faster than 10 times a second.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds.
#min_extrude_temp: 170
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) at which extruder move
#   commands may be issued. The default is 170 Celsius.
min_temp:
max_temp:
#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   heater must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. This check can help detect some
#   heater and sensor hardware failures. Set this range just wide
#   enough so that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error.
#   These parameters must be provided.

#   The height (in mm) that the head should be commanded to move to
#   just prior to starting a probe operation. The default is 5.
#mesh_radius:
#   Defines the radius of the mesh to probe for round beds. Note that
#   the radius is relative to the coordinate specified by the
#   mesh_origin option. This parameter must be provided for round beds
#   and omitted for rectangular beds.
#mesh_origin:
#   Defines the center X, Y coordinate of the mesh for round beds. This
#   coordinate is relative to the probe's location. It may be useful
#   to adjust the mesh_origin in an effort to maximize the size of the
#   mesh radius. Default is 0, 0. This parameter must be omitted for
#   rectangular beds.
#mesh_min:
#   Defines the minimum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. This coordinate is relative to the probe's location. This
#   will be the first point probed, nearest to the origin. This
#   parameter must be provided for rectangular beds.
#mesh_max:
#   Defines the maximum X, Y coordinate of the mesh for rectangular
#   beds. Adheres to the same principle as mesh_min, however this will
#   be the furthest point probed from the bed's origin. This parameter
#   must be provided for rectangular beds.
#probe_count: 3, 3
#   For rectangular beds, this is a comma separate pair of integer
#   values X, Y defining the number of points to probe along each
#   axis. A single value is also valid, in which case that value will
#   be applied to both axes. Default is 3, 3.
#round_probe_count: 5
#   For round beds, this integer value defines the maximum number of
#   points to probe along each axis. This value must be an odd number.
#   Default is 5.
#fade_start: 1.0
#   The gcode z position in which to start phasing out z-adjustment
#   when fade is enabled. Default is 1.0.
#fade_end: 0.0
#   The gcode z position in which phasing out completes. When set to a
#   value below fade_start, fade is disabled. It should be noted that
#   fade may add unwanted scaling along the z-axis of a print. If a
#   user wishes to enable fade, a value of 10.0 is recommended.
#   Default is 0.0, which disables fade.
#fade_target:
#   The z position in which fade should converge. When this value is
#   set to a non-zero value it must be within the range of z-values in
#   the mesh. Users that wish to converge to the z homing position
#   should set this to 0. Default is the average z value of the mesh.
#split_delta_z: .025
#   The amount of Z difference (in mm) along a move that will trigger
#   a split. Default is .025.
#move_check_distance: 5.0
#   The distance (in mm) along a move to check for split_delta_z.
#   This is also the minimum length that a move can be split. Default
#   is 5.0.
#mesh_pps: 2, 2
#   A comma separated pair of integers X, Y defining the number of
#   points per segment to interpolate in the mesh along each axis. A
#   "segment" can be defined as the space between each probed point.
#   The user may enter a single value which will be applied to both
#   axes. Default is 2, 2.
#algorithm: lagrange
#   The interpolation algorithm to use. May be either "lagrange" or
#   "bicubic". This option will not affect 3x3 grids, which are forced
#   to use lagrange sampling. Default is lagrange.
#bicubic_tension: .2
#   When using the bicubic algorithm the tension parameter above may
#   be applied to change the amount of slope interpolated. Larger
#   numbers will increase the amount of slope, which results in more
#   curvature in the mesh. Default is .2.
#relative_reference_index:
#   A point index in the mesh to reference all z values to. Enabling
#   this parameter produces a mesh relative to the probed z position
#   at the provided index.
#faulty_region_1_min:
#faulty_region_1_max:
#   Optional points that define a faulty region.  See docs/Bed_Mesh.md
#   for details on faulty regions.  Up to 99 faulty regions may be added.
#   By default no faulty regions are set.

#Stepper phase adjusted endstops. To use this feature, define a config section with an "endstop_phase" prefix followed by the name of the corresponding stepper config section (for example, "[endstop_phase stepper_z]"). This feature can improve the accuracy of endstop switches. Add a bare "[endstop_phase]" declaration to enable the ENDSTOP_PHASE_CALIBRATE command.
[endstop_phase stepper_z]
#endstop_accuracy:
#   Sets the expected accuracy (in mm) of the endstop. This represents
#   the maximum error distance the endstop may trigger (eg, if an
#   endstop may occasionally trigger 100um early or up to 100um late
#   then set this to 0.200 for 200um). The default is
#   4*rotation_distance/full_steps_per_rotation.
#trigger_phase:
#   This specifies the phase of the stepper motor driver to expect
#   when hitting the endstop. It is composed of two numbers separated
#   by a forward slash character - the phase and the total number of
#   phases (eg, "7/64"). Only set this value if one is sure the
#   stepper motor driver is reset every time the mcu is reset. If this
#   is not set, then the stepper phase will be detected on the first
#   home and that phase will be used on all subsequent homes.
#endstop_align_zero: False
#   If true then the position_endstop of the axis will effectively be
#   modified so that the zero position for the axis occurs at a full
#   step on the stepper motor. (If used on the Z axis and the print
#   layer height is a multiple of a full step distance then every
#   layer will occur on a full step.) The default is False.

#   The given variable name will be assigned the given value (parsed
#   as a Python literal) and will be available during macro expansion.
#   For example, a config with "variable_fan_speed = 75" might have
#   gcode commands containing "M106 S{ fan_speed * 255 }". Variables
#   can be changed at run-time using the SET_GCODE_VARIABLE command
#   (see docs/Command_Templates.md for details). Variable names may
#   not use upper case characters.
#rename_existing:
#   This option will cause the macro to override an existing G-Code
#   command and provide the previous definition of the command via the
#   name provided here. This can be used to override builtin G-Code
#   commands. Care should be taken when overriding commands as it can
#   cause complex and unexpected results. The default is to not
#   override an existing G-Code command.

#   Idle time (in seconds) to wait before running the above G-Code
#   commands. The default is 600 seconds.

# A virtual sdcard may be useful if the host machine is not fast enough to run OctoPrint well. It allows the Klipper host software to directly print gcode files stored in a directory on the host using standard sdcard G-Code commands (eg, M24).
[virtual_sdcard]
path:
#   The path of the local directory on the host machine to look for
#   g-code files. This is a read-only directory (sdcard file writes

[input_shaper]
#shaper_freq_x: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for X axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of X axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI

#   considerations. The default value is 0, which disables input
#   shaping for X axis.
#shaper_freq_y: 0
#   A frequency (in Hz) of the input shaper for Y axis. This is
#   usually a resonance frequency of Y axis that the input shaper
#   should suppress. For more complex shapers, like 2- and 3-hump EI

#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y, x, z" to swap the X and Y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x, z, -y"). The default is "x, y, z".
#rate: 3200
#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.

# Support for mpu9250 and mpu6050 accelerometers (one may define any number of sections with an "mpu9250" prefix).
[mpu9250 my_accelerometer]
#i2c_address:
#   Default is 104 (0x68).
#i2c_mcu:
#i2c_bus:
#i2c_speed: 400000
#   See the "common I2C settings" section for a description of the

#axes_map: x, y, z
#   See the "adxl345" section for information on this parameter.

# Support for resonance testing and automatic input shaper calibration. In order to use most of the functionality of this module, additional software dependencies must be installed; refer to Measuring Resonances and the command reference for more information. See the Max smoothing section of the measuring resonances guide for more information on max_smoothing parameter and its use.
[resonance_tester]
#probe_points:
#   A list of X, Y, Z coordinates of points (one point per line) to test
#   resonances at. At least one point is required. Make sure that all
#   points with some safety margin in XY plane (~a few centimeters)
#   are reachable by the toolhead.
#accel_chip:
#   A name of the accelerometer chip to use for measurements. If
#   adxl345 chip was defined without an explicit name, this parameter
#   can simply reference it as "accel_chip: adxl345", otherwise an
#   explicit name must be supplied as well, e.g. "accel_chip: adxl345
#   my_chip_name". Either this, or the next two parameters must be
#   set.
#accel_chip_x:
#accel_chip_y:
#   Names of the accelerometer chips to use for measurements for each
#   of the axis. Can be useful, for instance, on bed slinger printer,
#   if two separate accelerometers are mounted on the bed (for Y axis)
#   and on the toolhead (for X axis). These parameters have the same
#   format as 'accel_chip' parameter. Only 'accel_chip' or these two
#   parameters must be provided.
#max_smoothing:
#   Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
#   auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no
#   maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide
#   for more details on using this feature.
#min_freq: 5
#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
#max_freq: 133.33
#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 133.33 Hz.
#accel_per_hz: 75
#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
#hz_per_sec: 1
#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).

# Board pin aliases (one may define any number of sections with a "board_pins" prefix). Use this to define aliases for the pins on a micro-controller.
[board_pins my_aliases]
mcu: mcu
#   A comma separated list of micro-controllers that may use the
#   aliases. The default is to apply the aliases to the main "mcu".
aliases:
aliases_<name>:
#   A comma separated list of "name=value" aliases to create for the
#   given micro-controller. For example, "EXP1_1=PE6" would create an
#   "EXP1_1" alias for the "PE6" pin. However, if "value" is enclosed
#   in "<>" then "name" is created as a reserved pin (for example,
#   "EXP1_9=<GND>" would reserve "EXP1_9"). Any number of options
#   starting with "aliases_" may be specified.

# Z height probe. One may define this section to enable Z height probing hardware. When this section is enabled, PROBE and QUERY_PROBE extended g-code commands become available. Also, see the probe calibrate guide https://www.klipper3d.org/Probe_Calibrate.html. The probe section also creates a virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin. One may set the stepper_z endstop_pin to this virtual pin on cartesian style printers that use the probe in place of a z endstop. If using "probe:z_virtual_endstop" then do not define a position_endstop in the stepper_z config section.
[probe]
pin:
#   Probe detection pin. If the pin is on a different microcontroller
#   than the Z steppers then it enables "multi-mcu homing". This
#   parameter must be provided.

#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values will
#   be averaged. The default is to probe 1 time.
#sample_retract_dist: 2.0
#   The distance (in mm) to lift the toolhead between each sample (if
#   sampling more than once). The default is 2mm.
#lift_speed:
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples. The default is to use the same value as the 'speed'
#   parameter.
#samples_result: average
#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is average.
#samples_tolerance: 0.100
#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. If this tolerance is exceeded then either an error is
#   reported or the attempt is restarted (see
#   samples_tolerance_retries). The default is 0.100mm.
#samples_tolerance_retries: 0
#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. On a retry, all current samples are discarded
#   and the probe attempt is restarted. If a valid set of samples are
#   not obtained in the given number of retries then an error is
#   reported. The default is zero which causes an error to be reported
#   on the first sample that exceeds samples_tolerance.
#activate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probe attempt.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This may be
#   useful if the probe needs to be activated in some way. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead (eg, G1). The
#   default is to not run any special G-Code commands on activation.
#deactivate_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each probe attempt
#   completes. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. Do not
#   issue any commands here that move the toolhead. The default is to
#   not run any special G-Code commands on deactivation.

# BLTouch probe. One may define this section (instead of a probe section) to enable a BLTouch probe. See BL-Touch guide https://www.klipper3d.org/BLTouch.html and command reference for further information. A virtual "probe:z_virtual_endstop" pin is also created (see the "probe" section for the details).
[bltouch]
sensor_pin:

#   require a pullup on the sensor pin (prefix the pin name with "^").
#   This parameter must be provided.

#   provided.
#pin_move_time: 0.680
#   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for the BLTouch pin to
#   move up or down. The default is 0.680 seconds.
#stow_on_each_sample: True
#   This determines if Klipper should command the pin to move up
#   between each probe attempt when performing a multiple probe
#   sequence. Read the directions in docs/BLTouch.md before setting
#   this to False. The default is True.
#probe_with_touch_mode: False
#   If this is set to True then Klipper will probe with the device in
#   "touch_mode". The default is False (probing in "pin_down" mode).
#pin_up_reports_not_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports the probe in a "not
#   triggered" state after a successful "pin_up" command. This should
#   be True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in

#pin_up_touch_mode_reports_triggered: True
#   Set if the BLTouch consistently reports a "triggered" state after
#   the commands "pin_up" followed by "touch_mode". This should be
#   True for all genuine BLTouch devices. Read the directions in
#   docs/BLTouch.md before setting this to False. The default is True.
#set_output_mode:
#   Request a specific sensor pin output mode on the BLTouch V3.0 (and
#   later). This setting should not be used on other types of probes.
#   Set to "5V" to request a sensor pin output of 5 Volts (only use if
#   the controller board needs 5V mode and is 5V tolerant on its input
#   signal line). Set to "OD" to request the sensor pin output use
#   open drain mode. The default is to not request an output mode.

# Heater and temperature sensor verification. Heater verification is automatically enabled for each heater that is configured on the printer. Use verify_heater sections to change the default settings.
[verify_heater heater_config_name]
#max_error: 120
#   The maximum "cumulative temperature error" before raising an
#   error. Smaller values result in stricter checking and larger
#   values allow for more time before an error is reported.
#   Specifically, the temperature is inspected once a second and if it
#   is close to the target temperature then an internal "error
#   counter" is reset; otherwise, if the temperature is below the
#   target range then the counter is increased by the amount the
#   reported temperature differs from that range. Should the counter
#   exceed this "max_error" then an error is raised. The default is
#   120.
#check_gain_time:
#   This controls heater verification during initial heating. Smaller
#   values result in stricter checking and larger values allow for
#   more time before an error is reported. Specifically, during
#   initial heating, as long as the heater increases in temperature
#   within this time frame (specified in seconds) then the internal
#   "error counter" is reset. The default is 20 seconds for extruders
#   and 60 seconds for heater_bed.
#hysteresis: 5
#   The maximum temperature difference (in Celsius) to a target
#   temperature that is considered in range of the target. This
#   controls the max_error range check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 5.
#heating_gain: 2
#   The minimum temperature (in Celsius) that the heater must increase
#   by during the check_gain_time check. It is rare to customize this
#   value. The default is 2.

# Tool to disable heaters when homing or probing an axis.
[homing_heaters]
#steppers:
#   A comma separated list of steppers that should cause heaters to be
#   disabled. The default is to disable heaters for any homing/probing
#   move.
#   Typical example: stepper_z
#heaters:
#   A comma separated list of heaters to disable during homing/probing
#   moves. The default is to disable all heaters.
#   Typical example: extruder, heater_bed

# Custom thermistors (one may define any number of sections with a "thermistor" prefix). A custom thermistor may be used in the sensor_type field of a heater config section. (For example, if one defines a "[thermistor my_thermistor]" section then one may use a "sensor_type: my_thermistor" when defining a heater.) Be sure to place the thermistor section in the config file above its first use in a heater section.
[thermistor my_thermistor]
#temperature1:
#resistance1:
#temperature2:
#resistance2:
#temperature3:
#resistance3:
#   Three resistance measurements (in Ohms) at the given temperatures
#   (in Celsius). The three measurements will be used to calculate the
#   Steinhart-Hart coefficients for the thermistor. These parameters
#   must be provided when using Steinhart-Hart to define the
#   thermistor.
#beta:
#   Alternatively, one may define temperature1, resistance1, and beta
#   to define the thermistor parameters. This parameter must be
#   provided when using "beta" to define the thermistor.

# The atsam, atsamd, and stm32 micro-controllers contain an internal temperature sensor. One can use the "temperature_mcu" sensor to monitor these temperatures.
sensor_type: temperature_mcu
#sensor_mcu: mcu
#   The micro-controller to read from. The default is "mcu".
#sensor_temperature1:
#sensor_adc1:
#   Specify the above two parameters (a temperature in Celsius and an
#   ADC value as a float between 0.0 and 1.0) to calibrate the
#   micro-controller temperature. This may improve the reported
#   temperature accuracy on some chips. A typical way to obtain this
#   calibration information is to completely remove power from the
#   printer for a few hours (to ensure it is at the ambient
#   temperature), then power it up and use the QUERY_ADC command to
#   obtain an ADC measurement. Use some other temperature sensor on
#   the printer to find the corresponding ambient temperature. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.
#sensor_temperature2:
#sensor_adc2:
#   If sensor_temperature1/sensor_adc1 is specified then one may also
#   specify sensor_temperature2/sensor_adc2 calibration data. Doing so
#   may provide calibrated "temperature slope" information. The
#   default is to use the factory calibration data on the
#   micro-controller (if applicable) or the nominal values from the
#   micro-controller specification.

# Temperature from the machine (eg Raspberry Pi) running the host software.
sensor_type: temperature_host
#sensor_path:
#   The path to temperature system file. The default is
#   "/sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp" which is the temperature
#   system file on a Raspberry Pi computer.

# Print cooling fan.
[fan]
pin:
#   Output pin controlling the fan. This parameter must be provided.
#max_power: 1.0
#   The maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the
#   pin may be set to. The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully
#   enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the
#   pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. This setting may
#   be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to
#   the fan. If this value is less than 1.0 then fan speed requests
#   will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if
#   max_power is .9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested then the fan
#   power will be set to 72%). The default is 1.0.
#shutdown_speed: 0
#   The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if
#   the micro-controller software enters an error state. The default
#   is 0.
#cycle_time: 0.010
#   The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the
#   fan. It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when
#   using software based PWM. The default is 0.010 seconds.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. Most fans
#   do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to
#   enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at
#   very high speeds. When using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is
#   constrained by the implementation and may be significantly
#   different than the requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#kick_start_time: 0.100
#   Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first
#   enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan
#   spinning). The default is 0.100 seconds.
#off_below: 0.0
#   The minimum input speed which will power the fan (expressed as a
#   value from 0.0 to 1.0). When a speed lower than off_below is
#   requested the fan will instead be turned off. This setting may be
#   used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure kick starts are
#   effective. The default is 0.0.
#
#   This setting should be recalibrated whenever max_power is adjusted.
#   To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the
#   fan spinning. Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest
#   input speed which reliably drives the fan without stalls. Set
#   off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for
#   example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.
#tachometer_pin:
#   Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally
#   required. This parameter is optional.
#tachometer_ppr: 2
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per
#   revolution of the tachometer signal. For a BLDC fan this is
#   normally half the number of poles. The default is 2.
#tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0015
#   When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the
#   tachometer pin, in seconds. The default is 0.0015, which is fast
#   enough for fans below 10000 RPM at 2 PPR. This must be smaller than
#   30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the
#   maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.

# Heater cooling fans (one may define any number of sections with a "heater_fan" prefix). A "heater fan" is a fan that will be enabled whenever its associated heater is active. By default, a heater_fan has a shutdown_speed equal to max_power.

#   Initial angle (in degrees) to set the servo to. The default is to
#   not send any signal at startup.
#initial_pulse_width:
#   Initial pulse width time (in seconds) to set the servo to. (This
#   is only valid if initial_angle is not set.) The default is to not
#   send any signal at startup.

# Execute gcode when a button is pressed or released (or when a pin changes state). You can check the state of the button by using QUERY_BUTTON button=my_gcode_button.
[gcode_button my_gcode_button]
pin:
#   The pin on which the button is connected. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#analog_range:
#   Two comma separated resistances (in Ohms) specifying the minimum
#   and maximum resistance range for the button. If analog_range is
#   provided then the pin must be an analog capable pin. The default
#   is to use digital gpio for the button.
#analog_pullup_resistor:
#   The pullup resistance (in Ohms) when analog_range is specified.
#   The default is 4700 ohms.
#press_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when the button is pressed.
#   G-Code templates are supported. This parameter must be provided.
#release_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute when the button is released.
#   G-Code templates are supported. The default is to not run any
#   commands on a button release.

# Run-time configurable output pins (one may define any number of sections with an "output_pin" prefix). Pins configured here will be setup as output pins and one may modify them at run-time using "SET_PIN PIN=my_pin VALUE=.1" type extended g-code commands.

[output_pin my_pin]
pin:
#   The pin to configure as an output. This parameter must be
#   provided.
#pwm: False
#   Set if the output pin should be capable of pulse-width-modulation.
#   If this is true, the value fields should be between 0 and 1; if it
#   is false the value fields should be either 0 or 1. The default is
#   False.
#static_value:
#   If this is set, then the pin is assigned to this value at startup
#   and the pin can not be changed during runtime. A static pin uses
#   slightly less ram in the micro-controller. The default is to use
#   runtime configuration of pins.
#value:
#   The value to initially set the pin to during MCU configuration.
#   The default is 0 (for low voltage).
#shutdown_value:
#   The value to set the pin to on an MCU shutdown event. The default
#   is 0 (for low voltage).
#maximum_mcu_duration:
#   The maximum duration a non-shutdown value may be driven by the MCU
#   without an acknowledge from the host.
#   If host can not keep up with an update, the MCU will shutdown
#   and set all pins to their respective shutdown values.
#   Default: 0 (disabled)
#   Usual values are around 5 seconds.
#cycle_time: 0.100
#   The amount of time (in seconds) per PWM cycle. It is recommended
#   this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software based PWM.
#   The default is 0.100 seconds for pwm pins.
#hardware_pwm: False
#   Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. When
#   using hardware PWM the actual cycle time is constrained by the
#   implementation and may be significantly different than the
#   requested cycle_time. The default is False.
#scale:
#   This parameter can be used to alter how the 'value' and
#   'shutdown_value' parameters are interpreted for pwm pins. If
#   provided, then the 'value' parameter should be between 0.0 and
#   'scale'. This may be useful when configuring a PWM pin that
#   controls a stepper voltage reference. The 'scale' can be set to
#   the equivalent stepper amperage if the PWM were fully enabled, and
#   then the 'value' parameter can be specified using the desired
#   amperage for the stepper. The default is to not scale the 'value'
#   parameter.

# Multiple pin outputs (one may define any number of sections with a "multi_pin" prefix). A multi_pin output creates an internal pin alias that can modify multiple output pins each time the alias pin is set. For example, one could define a "[multi_pin my_fan]" object containing two pins and then set "pin=multi_pin:my_fan" in the "[fan]" section - on each fan change both output pins would be updated. These aliases may not be used with stepper motor pins.
[multi_pin my_multi_pin]
pins:
#   A comma separated list of pins associated with this alias. This
#   parameter must be provided.

#diag_pin:
#   The micro-controller pin attached to the DIAG line of the TMC2209
#   chip. The pin is normally prefaced with "^" to enable a pullup.
#   Setting this creates a "tmc2209_stepper_x:virtual_endstop" virtual
#   pin which may be used as the stepper's endstop_pin. Doing this
#   enables "sensorless homing". (Be sure to also set driver_SGTHRS to

#   (half-stepping) or 4 (full-stepping). The default is 4.
#click_pin:
#   The pin connected to 'enter' button or encoder 'click'. This

[filament_switch_sensor my_sensor]
#pause_on_runout: True
#   When set to True, a PAUSE will execute immediately after a runout
